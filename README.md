## Website Redesign of anglers.org

By taking the existing website and its content, we have created a different take on anglers.org for the Thames River Anglers Association.

We have created six fully designed wireframes as well as three coded pages (Home, About, and Contact) for the TRAA. Our concept for the design was based around condensing all of the information on their current site into optional flyout menus and smaller areas to allow for a more seamless scrolling experience. Users can now find exactly what they want faster and can choose what sections they want to learn more about.


## Functionality and Design

The original TRAA site had seven pages. We have shortened it down to six while preserving all of the contents inside. 

The "Home" page serves as a landing page and gives users a chance to navigate through the site's contents as a brief overview. There are links to the "About" and "Get Involved" pages with a carousel of past events leading to the "Projects" page. The TRAA has had sponsors in the past and links to each of their webpages are at the bottom of the homepage as well. The Facebook page is linked within the header as well as the Footer and there is a secondary contact button alongside it.

The "About" page tells the story of the TRAA and displays their ongoing projects, such as the Trout Hatchery, within our flyout menus. It also introduces the core team behind the TRAA with headshots and nametags. This is so that new members can immediately put a face to a name when seeing the name in the "Projects" page or recieving an email from one of these people. This helps emphasize the community aspect of the TRAA itself.

The old "Links" and "Projects" pages have been dissolved and dispersed across the "About" page and the new "Get Involved" page. This new page details useful links for fishing enthusiasts, how you can become a TRAA member, what merchandise you can pick up at meetings, and a quick contact form in case users have any questions right then and there.

The "Newsletter" archive has been redone by including the links for each letter with an image of the cover. We thought that this would be a much easier way to visually display the newsletters and allow people to click through them based on the covers instead of dates on a link. There is a link at the bottom that directs to the "Contact Us" page if an existing member has an old newsletter that is not within the archive.

The "Past Events" page has been renamed to "Past Projects" and it contains all of the most recent events that the TRAA has held. Each of these events are condensed within a flyout menu with the title of the event as well as the date. They are organized in chronological order and when clicked, display images and information about the event in a blog-post format. By using the flyout menus, this keeps the page from being an endless scroll if someone was interested in an event that happened a few years ago.

The "Contact Us" page has a contact form on the bottom, similar to the one on the "Get Involved" page that sends emails to the main TRAA account. Above is an embedded Google Maps link with the site of the TRAA meetings. People can click on the link or they can copy the address down in order to make it to the next meetings. This is an easier way to display the location as looking the TRAA up on Google Maps does not reveal any results that would be helpful.
